#Q Is Congnito Sync deprecated?
See: [Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-sync.html)
If you're new to Amazon Cognito Sync, use [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)

. Like Amazon Cognito Sync, AWS AppSync is a service for synchronizing application data across devices.

It enables user data like app preferences or game state to be synchronized. It also extends these capabilities by allowing multiple users to synchronize and collaborate in real time on shared data.
**Answer**: Yes. Use [[AppSync]] instead.
