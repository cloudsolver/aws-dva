The digital signature process provides a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, even when transmitted over an untrusted network.

1.  **Message Digest Creation:** The first step in creating a digital signature is to create a message digest. This is a fixed-length representation of the message that is created using a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-512. The message digest provides a way to verify that the message has not been tampered with during transmission.
    
2.  **Signing the Digest:** The sender then applies a digital signature algorithm, such as RSA or ECDSA, to the message digest using their private key. This creates a unique digital signature that is specific to the message and the sender's private key.
    
3.  **Attaching the Signature to the Message:** The digital signature is then attached to the message, typically as an additional field or block of data. This allows the recipient to verify the signature and confirm that the message was sent by the expected sender.
    
4.  **Verification of the Signature:** When the recipient receives the message, they extract the digital signature and the message digest. They then use the sender's public key to verify the signature by applying the same digital signature algorithm that the sender used to create the signature. This generates a second message digest.
    
5.  **Comparison of Message Digests:** The recipient then compares the second message digest with the original message digest that was transmitted along with the signature. If the two digests match, the recipient can be confident that the message was sent by the expected sender and that it has not been tampered with during transmission. If the digests do not match, this indicates that the message may have been tampered with, and the recipient may reject the message.
