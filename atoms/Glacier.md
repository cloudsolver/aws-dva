### Quiz
#Q A user is trying to create a vault in AWS Glacier. The user want to enable notifications. In which of the below mentioned options can the user enable the notifications from the AWS console?
(a) Glacier does not support the AWS console.
(b) Archival upload complete
(c) Vault upload job complete
(d) Vault Inventory Retrieval Job Complete
Answer: You can use the AWS Console to configure Vault Notifications (See this)[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/configuring-notifications-console.html]. You cannot upload directly to Glacier - therefore options (b) and (c) are invalid. S3 Glacier defines events specifically related to job completion (`ArchiveRetrievalCompleted`,Â `InventoryRetrievalCompleted`).
