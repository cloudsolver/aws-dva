CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing or supernetting) is a method of assigning [IP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/Internet-Protocol) addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.

It is a widely method for [[IP Address]] allocation.
The advantages of CIDR include:
-   More efficient use of IP addresses
-   Easier to manage IP addresses
-   Easier to route traffic
-   More flexibility in IP address assignment

#### Class Based IP Allocation System (Legacy)
In the past, IP addresses were divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each class had a different number of bits for the network portion of the address, with class A having the fewest bits and class E having the most bits. This was wasteful
