Connection-oriented transport protocol that sends data as an unstructured stream of bytes. 
### TCP Features
- Provides sending node with delivery information about packets transmitted to a destination node. 
- If data has been lost in transit from source to destination, TCP can retransmit the data
- Recognize duplicate messages and will discard them appropriately. 
- If transmission is too fast for the receiving computer, TCP can employ flow control mechanisms to slow data transfer.
- Communicates delivery information to the upper-layer protocols and applications it supports

### IP Features
IP is the primary Layer 3 protocol in the Internet suite. In addition to internetwork routing, IP provides error reporting and fragmentation and reassembly of information units called datagrams for transmission over networks with different maximum data unit sizes. IP represents the heart of the Internet Protocol suite.
