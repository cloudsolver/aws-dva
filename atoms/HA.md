High Availability is the quality attribute of an architecture that yields long term continuous operations without failure.

High availability (HA) refers to the ability of an IT system, component, or application to conform to a high level of operational performance continuously for a specific period without failing. High availability system environments include complex server clusters, as well as the capability to recover the system from unexpected events within the shortest time.
