### Summary of Config
Configuration Auditor. Assess, audit, and evaluate  configuration of your resource. #AWSService 
### Config Details
- Use the AWS Management Console, API, or CLI to obtain details of what a resourceâ€™s configuration looked like at any point in the past. It is a per-Region service.
- AWS Config will also automatically deliver a configuration history file to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket you specify.
> **Config Rules**
	Specify configuration rules and be notified when configuration changes don't meet the rules.
	Implement Policies in the Config Rules engine to implement practice.

**Config Notification Solution**
AWS Config can send a non-compliance event to [[EventBridge]] which can invoke a [[Lambda]] for remediation. Notifications can be sent via [[SNS]].
*Avoid*: AWS Batch (overkill)
*Note*: AWS Config can only use [[SSM]] Automation documents as remediation actions.

> Create a custom [[SSM Parameter Store]] Document that triggers a Lambda function which takes the action.

- Config now support organization wide compliance view.
- Aggregate from multi-account multi-region out of the box. Integrates with AWS [[Organizations]]
- Does not prevent policy violations - only detects, audits and notifies.
- #UseCase  
	Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
	Do my buckets have any public access?
	How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
