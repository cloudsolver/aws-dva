### Summary of CloudWatch
System-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health for every service. 
#AWSService 
### CloudWatch Details
- CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. AWS services puts metrics in cloudwatch, custom metrics can be put in cloudwatch.
![[CloudWatch Metrics Alarms Notifcations Actions Architecture.png | 512]]
- High resolution custom metrics and alarms support 1 second metrics
- Use `PutMetricData --timestamp` with optional `StorageResolution` - 1, 5, 10, 30 second intervals (expensive). Accepts metric data points two weeks in the past and 2 hours in the future.
- CloudWatch Alarms can take actions such as Terminate EC2 Instance.
- CloudWatch Unified Agent - is an installable agent that provides a lot more metrics e.g. memory consumption, swap space

#Q What are the main concepts of CloudWatch?
Answer: The following table outlines:

| Concept     | Description|
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Namespace   | A _namespace_ is a container for CloudWatch metrics.|
| Metric      | A metric represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Timestamp   | Each metric data point must be associated with a time stamp in UTC - Coordinated Universal Time                                                                                                                                                         |
| Dimension   | A _dimension_ is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.                                                                                                                            |
| Resolution  | Granularity of metric Standard = 1 min and High = 1 sec                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Statistics  | _Statistics_ are metric data aggregations over specified periods of time.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Unit        | Each statistic has a unit of measure. Example units include `Bytes`, `Seconds`, `Count`, and `Percent`.                                                                                                                                    |
| Period      | A _period_ is the length of time associated with a specific Amazon CloudWatch statistic.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Aggregation | Aggregates statistics according to the period length that you specify e.g. Web hit latency aggregation every 60 seconds                                                                                                                                 |
| Percentile  | Percentiles are often used to isolate anomalies.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Alarm       | You can use an _alarm_ to automatically initiate actions on your behalf. An alarm watches a single metric over a specified time period, and performs one or more specified actions, based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold over time. |

| Real Time      | Lambda                                |

_Subscriptions are filters that are applied to CloudWatch logs._

> **CloudWatch Multi-Region Multi-Account**
![[Cloudwatch Multiaccount Subscription Filter Architecture.png|512]]
Fig. Subscription Filter across Regions stream to KDS then KDF for near real-time

> **Hybrid and EC2 CloudWatch Architecture**
> Requires a CloudWatch Agent (only logs), new CloudWatch Unified Agent (RAM, CPU, Disk, Network is out of the box for EC2)
> ![[CloudWatch Agent Architecture.png|256]]

> **CloudWatch Alarm Targets Architecture**
> Alarms should be sent to SNS from there subscribers can take any action.
> SNS subscriber can be a Lambda function, and it can use AWS SDK to pretty much do anything with the appropriate role.
