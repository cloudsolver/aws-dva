## Summary
Bucket settings to Block Public Access can be set at the account level, and bucket level which will override any bucket-level policy that allows direct public access. Disable ACLs, use Bucket Policies
## S3 Security Details

1. Disable ACLs.
2. S3 should use Bucket Policies - which is a resource based policy.
3. Review all buckets that have a `*` wildcard on Principal and/or Action.
4. Use IAM Roles for AWS Services.
5. Ensure least privilege.
6. Encrypt Data at Rest with SSE or CSE.
7. WORM with S3 Locks: Retention, Compliance and Legal Holds are supported. There is no retention period for Legal Holds .
8. Cross-Region Replication and Versioning.
9. Identity and audit all S3 buckets.
10. Enable AWS S3 access logging. The access log buckets must be in the same region.
11. Enable [[CloudTrail]] , AWS [[Config]], [[Macie]] and use [S3 Storage Lens](S3.md#S3%20Storage%20Lens) 
12. 

### S3 Bucket Policies
The policy below has  a Version, and Statement (array). Each Statement has a statement id, effect, principal, action.
```
{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
"Statement":[
{
	"Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
	"Effect":"Allow",
	"Principal":"*",
	"Action":"s3:GetObject",
	"Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::spectrumvending.com/*"
	
}
]
}
```

### S3 Encryption
S3 Encryption is on by default, however Bucket policies are evaluated first and is always used first.
1. SSE-S3: Encryption with Amazon managed keys.
	1. There is no cost for this. #CostOptimized 
2. SSE-KMS: User must upload files with an HTTP-Header `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`
	1. S3 will invoke [[KMS]] API to encrypt objects. Encryption and decryption is done within Amazon S3 service.
	2. KMS produced key-encryption-keys are S3 Bucket keys that can save costs and improve performance. #BestPractice #performant #CostOptimized 
3. SSE-C: User supplies encryption key within the header of the request. 
	1. S3 will encrypt with this key, and never save it. 
	2. No Audit Trail is available.
	2. The connection to S3 must be encrypted.
4. Client Side Encryption: The client manages the key as well as the encryption and decryption process.
	1. S3 will store and retrieve encrypted objects as sent by the client.

#UseCase Enforce SSE with KMS. A bucket policy can enforce API calls to contain a header - otherwise invocations will be rejected.
```
"Condition":{"StringNotEquals":{"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"}}
```

#UseCase Enforce HTTPS only on S3. Create a bucket policy with a Deny effect with the following condition.
`"Condition":{"Bool":{"aws:SecureTransport":"false"}`

## MFA Delete
S3 allows the bucket owner (root account) to enable and disable MFA for deletes. #secure 
`aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket name --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn"` Note: This uses the `s3api` [command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/index.html?highlight=s3api).
## Quiz
You have updated an S3 bucket policy to allow IAM users to read/write files in the S3 bucket, but one of the users complain that he can't perform a `PutObject` API call. What is a possible cause for this?
(a) S3 bucket policy must be wrong.
(b) The user lacks permissions.
(c) IAM user must have an explicit DENY in the attached IAM policy.
Answer: This is tricky. It is definitely a permissions issue. But where? Well, if the answer is a typo or a mistake then d-uh. But it is a trick question as we must assume that the Bucket Policy is correct. Therefore, the question is trying to test the understanding of the student between what's in the bucket policy versus IAM policy. So (c) Explicit DENY in an IAM Policy will take precedence over an S3 bucket policy.

 #Q Which IAM policy condition allows you to enforce SSL requests to objects stored in your S3 bucket?
 Answer: `aws:secureTransport`
