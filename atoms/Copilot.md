**Are my existing ECS and Fargate services available in the CLI?**

Currently only services created through the CLI are available to manage. We are working on the capability to migrate existing AWS resources including clusters, tasks, and VPCs to be usable in the CLI.

**Is AWS Copilot a standalone AWS service?**

No, currently AWS Copilot is a CLI that deploys applications to AWS Fargate on Amazon ECS. Deployments to the EC2 launch type are coming soon.
