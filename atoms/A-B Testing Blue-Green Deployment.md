A/B testing, or multivariate testing, is a mechanism to compare two (or more) versions of the same feature or page, and compare the statistics of those versions to see which one performs better.

Blue-Green Deployments is one of many other engineering approaches achieve this include URL-splitting, canary releases with feature toggles, server-side switches.

`A/B` is a behavior monitoring paradigm. `Blue/Green` is an engineering process. That's it. The two can, and often are, used together with the same end goal: improve the user experience in regards to the product.
