[EC2 connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html) is a browser based CLI compatible with Amazon Linux 2 and Ubuntu 16.04 or later.

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect to your Linux instances using Secure Shell ([SSH](SSH.md)). With EC2 Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) and [principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) to control [SSH](SSH.md) access to your instances, removing the need to share and manage [SSH](SSH.md) keys.
