| Deployment Config    | Set of deployment rules for success or failure e.g. min number of healthy instances       |
| Deployment Group     | Group of tagged EC2 instances |
| Deployment Type      | Method used to deploy the application to a Deployment Group eg. In-place, Blue/Green      |
| IAM Instance Profile | EC2 instances the permissions to access S3 or GitHub                                      |

| Target Revision      | The most recent revision that you want to deploy to a Deployment Group                    |

#Q What are the CodeDeploy Deployment Configurations?
Answer:  
1. One at a time: One EC2 instance at a time, if one instance fails, then deployment stops
2. Half at a Time: 50%
3. All At Once; Good for dev env as it's the fastest
4. Custom: 25% etc.
---

#Q How are Failures handled?
**Answer**: EC2 instances stay in the "failed" state. New deployments will first be deployed to failed instances. 

---

#Q How are Rollback handled?
**Answer**: In order to rollback, redeploy old deployment or enable rollback or failure. Automation can be achieved via a [[CloudWatch]] alarm. Rollback occurs, by redeploying the last known successful deployment. There is no PITR for applications. 

#Q Can AWS Lambda deployments use in-place deployment type?
 Answer: No. AWS Lambda compute platform deployments cannot use an in-place deployment type.
